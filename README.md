# Data Visualization with Python 📊 | Matplotlib & Seaborn

 The use of Python's powerful data visualization libraries — **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** — to explore and communicate insights from a business dataset. The visualizations help uncover patterns in sales, profit, discounts, and regional performance.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Bar plots for category-wise sales comparison
- Scatter plot to analyze relationship between sales and profit
- Histogram to explore quantity distribution
- Box plots for regional discount analysis
- Correlation heatmap for understanding variable relationships
